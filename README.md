# ThesisDocs
It consist of the simulation and PIL models designed in MATLAB/Simulink. 
You can test your designed algorithms such as;
  - Potential functions
  - Any kind of motion controller
  - Neural network models
  - Kinematic models
  Please read the statements inside simulation and PIL model to get successfull results...
